# HarryPotter_web
This project is about a web application that helps us to visualize the schools and the characters of the Harry Potter movie and we can search for the characters by first and last name

This web consumes brings the data using the Api:http://hp-api.herokuapp.com/api/characters

git  https://github.com/granadalook/HarryPotter_web 
cd intern-angular
```shell
Install npm packages
Install the npm packages described in the package.json and verify that it works:
