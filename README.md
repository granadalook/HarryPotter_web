# HarryPotter_web
This project is about a web application that helps us to visualize the schools and the characters of the Harry Potter movie and we can search for the characters by first and last name

This web consumes brings the data using the Api:http://hp-api.herokuapp.com/api/characters

Install npm packages
Install the npm packages described in the package.json and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```
The npm start command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into dist/, watches for changes to the source files, and runs lite-server on port 4200 by default.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.
